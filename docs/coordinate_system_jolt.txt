
Jolt Physics Coordinate System Conventions
============================================

Handedness:     Right-handed (RH)
Up axis:        +Y


World space 3D:
    x is to the right
    y is to the up
    z is to the backward  (opposite of SHS forward!)


Cross product in RH:
    x cross y = -z
    (0,0,-1) is "forward" direction (into the screen)


Quaternion convention:
    JPH::Quat components = (x, y, z, w)  Hamilton convention


Matrix convention:
    JPH::Mat44 is column-major (same storage layout as GLM).
    Column 0 = X axis, Column 1 = Y axis, Column 2 = Z axis, Column 3 = Translation.


=======================================================================
Conversion Rules:  SHS (LH, +Z forward)  <->  Jolt (RH, -Z forward)
=======================================================================

The two systems share X and Y axes but have opposite Z direction.
All conversions reduce to negating the Z component.


Position vector:
    JPH::Vec3(v.x, v.y, -v.z)      // SHS -> Jolt
    glm::vec3(v.GetX(), v.GetY(), -v.GetZ())  // Jolt -> SHS


Direction vector:
    Same as position: negate Z.


Quaternion:
    Negate X and Y components (equivalent to Z-flip conjugation).
    JPH::Quat(-q.x, -q.y, q.z, q.w)   // SHS -> Jolt
    glm::quat(q.GetW(), -q.GetX(), -q.GetY(), q.GetZ())  // Jolt -> SHS

    Derivation: If S = diag(1,1,-1) is the Z-flip matrix, then for
    rotation matrix R, the converted rotation is S*R*S. In quaternion
    form this corresponds to negating the X and Y imaginary parts.


4x4 Matrix:
    M_jolt = S * M_shs * S   where S = diag(1, 1, -1, 1)

    This flips the 3rd row and 3rd column entries.
    S is its own inverse (S * S = I), so the reverse is identical:
    M_shs  = S * M_jolt * S


Plane (normal + distance):
    Negate normal.z, keep distance d unchanged.
    JPH::Plane({n.x, n.y, -n.z}, d)


AABB:
    After negating Z, the min/max Z values swap:
    jolt_min = (shs_min.x,  shs_min.y, -shs_max.z)
    jolt_max = (shs_max.x,  shs_max.y, -shs_min.z)


Shapes (Sphere, Capsule, Box, Cylinder):
    Symmetric shapes (sphere, box, cylinder, capsule) do not need
    Z-flipping for their intrinsic parameters (radius, half-extents).
    Only their position/orientation must be converted.


ConvexHull vertices:
    Each vertex has Z negated before passing to JPH::ConvexHullShapeSettings.


Scale:
    Both systems use identical units. No scale factor needed.
