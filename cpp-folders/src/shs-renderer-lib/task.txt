Core

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/core/context.hpp
	Defines shs::Context (concrete, not forward-declared).

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/core/types.hpp
	Basic shared types: Color, small math aliases, common enums (keep tiny).

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/core/config.hpp
	Compile-time toggles / constants (optional, but helps keep headers clean).


Render-target / RT types

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/passes/rt_types.hpp
	Defines RT_ColorDepthVelocity, RT_ColorDepthMotion (alias), DefaultRT.


Pass plumbing (common interfaces + shared structs)

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/passes/pass_common.hpp
	Includes context.hpp + rt_types.hpp
	Defines PassContext (ctx, rt, frame index, dt, etc.).

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/passes/pass_interface.hpp
	Defines the common pass interface, e.g. struct IPass { virtual void execute(PassContext&) = 0; }
	(or non-virtual “pass.execute(ctx)” convention ).

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/passes/pass_graph.hpp
	Simple runner/registry: list of passes, add_pass(), execute_all().


Shared resources (optional now, but you will want soon)

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/resources/texture.hpp
	Texture handle + loading API (SDL_image boundary lives here later).

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/resources/mesh.hpp
	Mesh/model structs used by multiple demos.

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/resources/material.hpp
	PBR material parameters shared across passes/demos.


Built-in passes (each pass = one header)

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/passes/pass_pbr.hpp

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/passes/pass_shadow_map.hpp

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/passes/pass_light_shafts.hpp

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/passes/pass_motion_blur.hpp

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/passes/pass_dof.hpp

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/passes/pass_tonemap.hpp

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/passes/pass_skybox.hpp

Convenience umbrella include (optional)

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/shs_renderer_lib.hpp

Includes the minimal “public API” headers you want demos to include.
