Core

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/core/context.hpp
	Defines shs::Context (concrete, not forward-declared).
	Context should hold shared frame/runtime state only (no pipeline-local Vulkan-like emulation ownership).

src/shs-renderer-lib/src/shs_renderer_lib.cpp
	Compiled library anchor translation unit (post-INTERFACE packaging step).

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/core/types.hpp
	Basic shared types: Color, small math aliases, common enums (keep tiny).

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/core/config.hpp
	Compile-time toggles / constants (optional, but helps keep headers clean).

Scene contracts

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/scene/scene_types.hpp
	Canonical scene API for modern pipeline/pass code (Scene, Camera, RenderItem).


Render-target / RT types

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/gfx/rt_types.hpp
	Defines RT_ColorDepth, RT_ColorDepthVelocity, RT_ColorDepthMotion (alias), DefaultRT.


Pass plumbing (common interfaces + shared structs)
	
src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/passes/pass_context.hpp
	Defines lightweight pass context (ctx, rt, frame index, dt, camera pointers).
	Legacy scene-data binding removed; bind modern shs::Scene only.

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/pipeline/pluggable_pipeline.hpp
	Canonical pass orchestration with pass contracts + graph validation.
	

Shared resources (optional now, but you will want soon)

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/resources/texture.hpp
	Texture handle + loading API (SDL_image boundary lives here later).

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/resources/mesh.hpp
	Mesh/model structs used by multiple demos.

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/resources/material.hpp
	PBR material parameters shared across passes/demos.

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/resources/ibl.hpp
	Shared environment IBL contracts/helpers:
	- CubeMapLinear, PrefilteredSpecular, EnvIBL
	- irradiance/prefilter precompute + cubemap/specular sampling.


Built-in passes (each pass = one header)

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/passes/pass_pbr.hpp

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/passes/pass_shadow_map.hpp

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/passes/pass_light_shafts.hpp

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/passes/pass_motion_blur.hpp

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/passes/pass_dof.hpp

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/passes/pass_tonemap.hpp

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/passes/pass_skybox.hpp

Convenience umbrella include (optional)

src/shs-renderer-lib/include/shs/shs_renderer_lib.hpp

Includes the minimal “public API” headers you want demos to include.
